FOSSIA Spotlights is an intiative to encourage our first time contributors and mentors to share their experience on contributing and mentoring under [FOSSIA](https://fossia.org).

# Why?

FOSSIA as a friendly and inclusive free software organization, aims to make the process of making your first-time contribution less intimidating and more rewarding. We celebrate and actively support our new contributor's journey into the free software ecosystem.

By providing a space for our first-time contributors to share their journeys, we aim to provide collective information for other beginners to contribute to our projects and the overall free software ecosystem.

We also shed spotlight and acknowledge our mentor's supportive guidance to our first-time contributors, highlighting the importance of giving back in the free software ecosystem.

[Contribute or help us in mentoring maintain our projects to get featured and share your insights with the community](https://github.com/fossiaorg/spotlights/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
